How Do I Look?
=====

How Do I Look is non-serious attempt at solving the problem every guy faces. It's a random generator for responses to the "How do I look?" question women ask, so that we have more options than "Nice!", "Pretty!" and "Beautiful!".

**PS**: I don't take any responsibilty if your relationship lands in trouble after using some these responses.
